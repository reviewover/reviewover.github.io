                <h2>Drivers Are Being Ripped Off By Not Following One Simple Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    <small>September 19, 2014</small>
                </p>
                <img src="main.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" style="margin-top:1.5rem; margin-bottom:2.5rem">
                <p class="lead">New policies prove drivers have likely overpaid on car insurance coverage for years. Can this be the end of overpriced insurance rates?
                </p>
                <p>This is the 1 simple truth your car insurance company doesn't want you to know. If you are currently insured, drive less than 50 miles/day and live in a qualified zip code you can get an extremely high discount. Additionally, if you have no DUI's, you can get even more discounts. But do you think Smart Life Easy company will tell you that? When drivers visit BestCar Insurance™ official site and enter their zip code, the results can be pretty shocking. We weren’t surprised when we got questions from drivers if these rates are real. The truth is people say it‘s possible to save 50% on their car insurance costs and some say they were eligible for rates as low as $9/ week due to recent insurance policy changes. When we heard about these claims, we decided to investigate it for ourselves.</p>

                <p>Our in house financial team set out to test these types of comparison services and after a few days of research what they found was very exciting. Our team discovered that not only were these claims true, but that one of our team members ended up saving over $500 a year when compared to what they were previously paying. They also found that many other people are indeed able to save similar amounts.</p>

                <p>So, what is the "One Simple Rule?" NEVER buy insurance without comparing all of the discounts available to you through an unbiased source. Are you being scammed by your insurance agent? Our research indicates that many people are being misled by their current insurance carriers into thinking that they are paying a fair rate when in fact it could be their insurance agents are intentionally keeping the lowest prices from customers in order to charge more money. When one of our team members confronted their previous insurance agent about this, they were told that "because there are so many options, I didn't have a chance to tell you about the all of them." Yeah, right.</p>



                <p>You are NOT locked into your current policy. If you pre-paid for your current policy you can cancel it and get back the balance of your pre-paid amount.</p>

                <p>What most people don’t realize is an insurance agent typically makes money off of the policies they sell, so the higher the premium the more they can get paid. Thankfully, smart drivers have found out how to drastically cut their insurance bill by using online tools to get unbiased quotes.</p>

                <p>Since drivers average savings are up to 50%, it’s no wonder services like these are growing rapidly. Our research concluded that BestCar Insurance™ is one of the most reliable, trusted services and highly effective tools to provide consumers with low rates. We thank BestCar Insurance™ for providing such an amazing service with an honest effort to saving money for families across America. You can click here if you would like to use the online tool to enjoy the benefits of this free service. Simply take a few seconds and enter your zip code to gain access to the system's no obligation quotes.</p>
